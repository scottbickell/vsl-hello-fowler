Hi, my name is KENDAR FOWLER and I am your local representative for Voyager Sopris Learning.

As a company we provide literacy, math and professional development solutions to help students and teachers achieve the success that they deserve.

As your representative, I will work with you to identify your areas of need, recommend potential solutions and collaborate with you to provide the best support to reach your goals.

I would love to schedule 15 minutes of your time to introduce myself in person and learn about your district.

Thank you!
KENDAR FOWLER
